        <p>, alright, woah </p>
        <p>you pointing at me with that knife? </p>
        <p>I've been cutting corners all my life, girl</p>
        <p> The terror doesn't blossom overnight, no</p>
        <p> She's running through the city in a rampage</p>
        <p> Pressing on her fingers till the bones break</p>
        <p> There's blood all in her nose from the propane</p>
        <p> But a needle to the skin will make the pain fade (yeah)</p>
        <p> Yeah, ah-ah</p>
        <p> This is what I do, ah-ah</p>
        <p> Take another bite, ah-ah</p>
        <p> Big enough to chew</p>
        
        
        <p> She said: Careful, or you'll lose it</p>
        <p>   But, girl, I'm only human</p>
        <p>    And I know there's a blade where your heart is</p>
        <p>   And you know how to use it</p>
        <p>    And you can take my flesh if you want, girl</p>
        <p>    But, baby, don't abuse it</p>
        <p>   These voices in my head screaming: Run now</p>
        <p>    I'm praying that they're human</p>

        <p>   Rollin', rollin', rolling back your eyes to your mind like</p>
        <p>   Oh, woah, the pressure in the gland's tight</p>
        <p>   Yeah, woah, yeah, it's either kill or be killed, like</p>
        <p>     Oh, woah, the blood is either poured or it's spilt, like</p>
        
        <p>   Yeah, ah-ah</p>
        <p>  This is what I do, ah-ah</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                 
        <p>    Take another bite, ah-ah</p>
        <p>  Big enough to chew</p>
        
        She said: Careful, or you'll lose it</p>
        <p>    <p>   But, girl, I'm only human</p>
        <p>   And I know there's a blade where your heart is</p>
        <p>    And you know how to use it</p>
        <p>   And you can take my flesh if you want, girl</p>
        <p>   But, baby, don't abuse it</p>
        <p>   These voices in my head screaming: Run now</p>
        <p>   I'm praying that they're human</p>
        
        <p>   Alright, alright, woah</p>
        <p>   Love you, but you cannot spend the night, nah</p>
        <p>   I've been alone almost all my life, girl</p>
        <p>  And shit like that don't change up overnight (sweet)</p>
        <p>   I let you sleep in my tee</p>
        <p>   Tell me the things that you don't normally tweet</p>
        <p>  Acid and LSD and smokin' blunts on the beach</p>
        <p>   Sixty-nine down sixty-nine, so we can both get a piece, yeah</p>
        <p>    I've been cutting corners like my whole life</p>
        <p>    Backstabbing bitches tryna' kill me with the whole knife</p>
        <p>   Day I die'll be the only day a nigga ghostwrite</p>
        <p>    When I go, they'll treat me like a God if this shit goes right</p>
        
        <p>   She said: Careful, or you'll lose it</p>
        <p>   But, girl, I'm only human</p>
        <p>   And I know there's a blade where your heart is</p>
        <p>   And you know how to use it</p>
        <p>   And you can take my flesh if you want, girl</p>
        <p>   But, baby, don't abuse it (calm down)</p>
        <p>   These voices in my head screaming: Run now (don't run)</p>
        <p>  I'm praying that they're human</p>
        
        <p>   Please understand that I'm trying my hardest</p>
        <p>    My head's a mess, but I'm trying regardless</p>
        <p>   Anxiety is one hell of a problem</p>
        <p>   She's latching onto me, I can't resolve it</p>
        <p>   It's not right, it's not fair, it's not fair</p>
        <p>   It's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair</p>
        <p>   Oh, no, no, no (don't run)</p>
        <p> Don't run, don't run</p>
